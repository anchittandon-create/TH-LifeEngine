## 📋 GPT Builder Setup Steps

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)
After pushing to GitHub, Vercel automatically deploys. Check:
- Go to https://vercel.com
- Find "TH-LifeEngine" project
- Wait for "Building" → "Ready" status

### Step 2: Verify Privacy Page
Open in **Incognito/Private mode**:
```
https://th-life-engine.vercel.app/privacy
```

✅ Should show:
- "TH_LifeEngine Privacy Policy" heading
- Clean, readable text
- No login required
- No errors

### Step 3: Add to GPT Builder
1. Go to https://chatgpt.com
2. Click profile → "My GPTs"
3. Find your GPT → Click "Edit"
4. Click "Configure" tab
5. Scroll to "Actions" section
6. Find "Privacy policy" field
7. Paste: `https://th-life-engine.vercel.app/privacy`
8. Click **Save** (top right corner)

✅ Expected: Green checkmark or "Saved" confirmation

### Step 4: Publish GPT
1. Click "Update" button (top right)
2. Choose sharing: "Anyone with the link" or "Public"
3. Click "Confirm"
4. Copy your GPT share URL

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### If GPT Builder rejects the URL:

**Method 1: Toggle Visibility**
1. Change GPT visibility to "Only me"
2. Save
3. Change back to "Anyone with the link"
4. Save
5. Re-enter privacy URL
6. Save again

**Method 2: Check Deployment**
```bash
# Test if URL is accessible
curl -I https://th-life-engine.vercel.app/privacy

# Should return:
# HTTP/2 200
```

**Method 3: Verify in Multiple Browsers**
- Chrome Incognito
- Firefox Private Window
- Safari Private Browsing

All should load the page without errors.

### Common Issues:

**Issue:** "URL is not accessible"
- **Fix:** Wait 2-3 more minutes for Vercel deployment
- **Check:** Vercel dashboard for deployment status

**Issue:** "Privacy policy must be publicly accessible"
- **Fix:** Verify page loads in Incognito mode
- **Check:** No login/authentication required

**Issue:** "Invalid URL"
- **Fix:** Ensure HTTPS and exact URL format
- **Check:** Copy/paste carefully, no extra spaces

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test 1: HTTP Status
```bash
curl -I https://th-life-engine.vercel.app/privacy
```
Expected: `HTTP/2 200`

### Test 2: Content Check

```
Expected: Should find the heading

### Test 3: No Redirects

## 📝 What Changed

**Before:** Fancy styled page with gradients and cards  
**After:** Simple prose-based layout with clean formatting  

**Why:** GPT Builder's validation works better with simpler HTML/CSS. The `prose` class from Tailwind provides clean, readable typography without complex styling.

**Code:**
```tsx
<main className="prose mx-auto p-6">
  {/* Simple, clean content */}
</main>
```
